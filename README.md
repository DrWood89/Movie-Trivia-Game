### 1-Description :page\_facing\_up:

   A well designed, well presented and timed 10 questions Trivia Game about classic movies and actors!
  To build this app i use HTML as my skeleton and CSS MakeUp as i call it to beautify and shape how 
  our data is being display to the user. JQuery aka JavaScript's son came very handy in building the logic 
  for the app and to simplify the code a little. 
   
   Upon launching the site our page will populate with our app frame including a start button and 
  a 15 seconds clock ready to go. Upon starting the app our page will populate with a question and a list 
  of four possible answers. Then the clock will start to decreement, You have fifteen seconds to answer. 
  after choosing your answer which you can only choose one, upon submitting you can't take it back. If your answer 
  was correct you get a thumbs up else if the answer submitted was not correct you get a thumbs down and display the 
  correct answer else the clock runs out you get a thumbs down and display the correct answer then call the next
  question function which will display the question. This action will repeat itself until we go through our 
  array of questions.
  
   This app is to showcase the ability to work with html, css and jquery to build logic and create a basic well
   designed and working as intented web app.
